# iris

A new Flutter project.


Flutter Iris Prediction App
The Flutter Iris Prediction App is a mobile application built with Flutter for the frontend and Flask for the backend. This app predicts the species of an iris flower based on input measurements using a machine learning model hosted on a Flask server.

Getting Started
Flutter App Setup
Clone the repository for the Flutter app:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-iris-prediction-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd flutter-iris-prediction-app
Install Flutter dependencies:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
Run the Flutter app:

bash
Copy code
flutter run
Flask Backend Setup
Clone the repository for the Flask backend:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-iris-prediction-backend.git
Navigate to the Flask project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd flask-iris-prediction-backend
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Unix/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
Install Flask and required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Usage
Ensure both the Flutter app and Flask backend are running.

Open the Flutter app on an emulator or physical device.

Enter the values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width into the input fields.

Press the "Predict" button to send the input measurements to the Flask backend.

View the predicted iris species returned by the backend on the Flutter app interface.
